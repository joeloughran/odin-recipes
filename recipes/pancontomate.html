    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Pan con Tomate (Spanish Tomato Bread) is a popular Catalan tapa made with simple ingredients including fresh tomatoes, hearty bread, garlic, and olive oil! A few tips make all the difference. </p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Russtic bread (I used Ciabatta bread)</li>
        <li>3 Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic – A large clove is best for rubbing all over the bread.</li>
        <li>Salt – You can use sea salt or kosher salt in this recipe.</li>
        <li>Lime juice – Optional but adds a nice flavor to contrast the tomato and garlic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Oil and toast the bread. Slice the ciabatta loaf in half length-wise then into 2-inch slices. Brush with good olive oil and arrange on a sheet pan. Toast about 6 inches from the broiler for 3 minutes or less, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Grate the tomatoes. Make a small cut at the top of the tomato an over the large holes of a box grater. Season with salt and a splash of lime juice (optional).</li>
        <li>Assemble the tomato bread. When the bread is ready, rub the garlic cloves over the hot bread. Spread the tomato puree over the bread and then serve.</li>
